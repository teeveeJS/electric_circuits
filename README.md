# Interactive Simulation of Electric Circuits
A responsive program where the user will directly interface with an electric circuit, controlling its connections, components, and their values. The available components include, but are not necessarily limited to, voltage sources, switches, resistors, capacitors, and inductors. The user will be able to construct unique circuits from the above-mentioned components or explore various basic circuits, such as RC and LC circuits.

In terms of code, the program will use:
* Kirchhoff's Loop Rules
	* Matrices and linear algebra to solve systems of equations
* Numerical approximations to differential equations
	* To model the behavior of capacitors and inductors
* Object-oriented programming to organize the components and their properties
* A Python GUI (such as TKinter) to interface between the user and the program
* Matplotlib.pyplot to represent various data from the circuits
	* A graph of Current vs. Time in a RC circuit, for instance
* And undoubtedly more!
